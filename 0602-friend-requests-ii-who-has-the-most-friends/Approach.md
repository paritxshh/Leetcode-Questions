â€‹Let me break it down a bit and explain the approach:

1. You have a subquery '(s)' that uses 'UNION ALL' to combine the 'requester_id' and 'accepter_id' columns from the requestaccepted table into a single column named 
    'id'.
  
2. The outer query then takes the result from the subquery '(s)' and performs a 'GROUP BY' on the 'id' column, which effectively groups the IDs together.

3. The 'COUNT(id)' function is used to count how many times each ID appears in the combined list of 'requester_id' and 'accepter_id'.

4. The result is sorted in descending order of the count using 'ORDER BY count(id) DESC', so that the ID with the highest count appears first.

5. Finally, 'LIMIT 1' is used to retrieve only the top result, which corresponds to the ID that appears most frequently in the combined columns.
