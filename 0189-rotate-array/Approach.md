This code is a Java solution for rotating an array of integers 'nums' by a specified number of positions 'k' to the right. The rotation is done in-place, meaning 
that the original array is modified without using additional space.

Here's how the code works:

1. The rotate function takes an array 'nums' and an integer 'k' as its parameters.
   
2. Since rotating an array by its length or multiples of its length doesn't change its original order, 'k' is reduced modulo 'nums.length' to ensure that we only 
    perform the necessary rotations.

3. The reverse function is called three times to achieve the rotation:
   - The first call to reverse reverses the entire array. This effectively brings the last 'k' elements to the front of the array.
   - The second call to reverse reverses the subarray from index '0' to index 'k-1'. This puts the last 'k' elements in their correct positions at the end of the 
      array.
   - The third call to reverse reverses the subarray from index 'k' to the end of the array. This ensures that the remaining elements are in their correct positions.

4. The reverse function takes an array nums and two indices 'l' and 'r' as parameters. It uses a two-pointer approach to swap elements while moving towards the 
   center of the subarray. The swap function is used to swap two elements in the array.


In summary, this algorithm efficiently rotates the array by first reversing the entire array, then reversing the two subarrays created by splitting at index 'k'. 
This results in the desired right rotation of the array by 'k' positions. The code achieves this with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the array.
