This code is a Java implementation of a solution to the "Minimum Number of Taps to Open to Water a Garden" problem, which is a variation of the interval scheduling 
problem. The problem statement goes as follows:

You have a garden with 'n + 1' taps located at points '0, 1, 2, ..., n' in a row. You are given an array ranges where 'ranges[i]' represents the radius of coverage 
of the 'i-th' tap. You need to water the entire garden using the minimum number of taps. If it's not possible to water the entire garden, return '-1'.

The code provides an approach to solving this problem using dynamic programming and interval scheduling techniques.

Here's a breakdown of the approach:

1. Create an array nums of size n + 1 to store the information about each tap's coverage. Initialize this array to all zeros.

2. Iterate through each tap from '0 to n':
   - Calculate the leftmost and rightmost positions that this tap can cover. These values are 'i - ranges[i]' and 'i + ranges[i]', respectively.
   - For each position within this interval, update the value in the 'nums' array with the maximum coverage length.

3. Initialize variables:
   - 'ans' to keep track of the minimum number of taps used.
   - 'end' to track the rightmost position that has been covered by the taps used so far.
   - 'far' to track the farthest right position that can be reached using the taps selected so far.
  
4. Iterate through each position from '0' to 'n - 1':
   - Update the 'far' value with the maximum of the current far and the coverage value at position 'i' in the 'nums' array.
   - If the current position equals end, it means all taps that cover the area up to this point have been considered. So, a new tap is needed.
   - Increment 'ans' and update 'end' to the current 'far' value.

5. After the loop, check if the entire garden (up to position n) is covered. If 'end' is equal to 'n', return 'ans'; otherwise, return -1.


The code employs dynamic programming to determine the maximum coverage for each position and then uses interval scheduling logic to determine the minimum number of 
taps required to cover the entire garden.
