The problem involves moving from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the grid while keeping track of both the maximum and minimum products of the values encountered along the way.

Here's a breakdown of the approach:

1. Initialize constants and variables:
   - kMod is a constant used to take modulo of the final answer.
   - m represents the number of rows in the grid.
   - n represents the number of columns in the grid.
   - dpMin is a 2D array to store the minimum products from (0, 0) to (i, j).
   - dpMax is a 2D array to store the maximum products from (0, 0) to (i, j).â€‹
  
2. Initialize the first element of both dpMin and dpMax with the value from the grid's top-left corner.

3. Fill the first column and first row of dpMin and dpMax with cumulative products. This is because there's only one way to move in the first column (down) and the 
    first row (right).

4. Iterate through the rest of the grid (excluding the first row and first column) using a nested loop:
   - If the current value in the grid is negative, update dpMin with the maximum of the products obtained from moving either down or right to the current cell, and   
      update dpMax with the minimum of the products obtained from moving either down or right to the current cell, both multiplied by the current grid value.
   - If the current value in the grid is non-negative, update dpMin with the minimum of the products obtained from moving either down or right to the current cell, 
      and update dpMax with the maximum of the products obtained from moving either down or right to the current cell, both multiplied by the current grid value.

5. After iterating through the grid, the maximum product will be stored in either dpMin[m - 1][n - 1] or dpMax[m - 1][n - 1], depending on whether the last element is negative or non-negative.

6. Calculate the final answer by taking the maximum of the two products and then applying modulo kMod to the result.

7. If the final answer is negative (max < 0), return -1. Otherwise, return the final answer as an integer.


It's important to note that the code handles both positive and negative values in the grid, ensuring that it tracks both the minimum and maximum products at each step, considering the possibility of negative values affecting the products.
