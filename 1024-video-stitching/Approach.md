â€‹This Java code defines a 'Solution' class with a 'videoStitching' method that takes two parameters: an array of video clips represented by a 2D array 'clips' and 
an integer 'time'. The goal of this method is to determine the minimum number of clips needed to cover the entire time interval from 0 to time.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code's approach:

1. Initialize variables:
   - 'ans' is used to keep track of the number of clips used.
   - 'end' represents the end time of the current clip being considered.
   - 'farthest' represents the farthest end time reached while iterating through the clips.

2. Sort the 'clips' array based on the starting time of each clip using a custom comparator '(a, b) -> a[0] - b[0])'. This ensures that clips are processed in 
   ascending order of their starting times.

3. Initialize a pointer 'i' to 0, which will be used to iterate through the sorted 'clips' array.

4. Use a 'while' loop to continue iterating until 'farthest' is greater than or equal to the 'time', indicating that the entire time interval has been covered.

5. Inside the loop:
   - Use another 'while' loop to iterate through 'clips' while their 'start' times are less than or equal to 'end'. This loop finds all clips that can be extended 
     from the current clip, updating farthest to the maximum end time encountered during this process.
   - If 'end' is equal to 'farthest', it means that no progress can be made, and the method returns '-1', indicating that it's not possible to cover the entire 
     time interval with the given clips.

6. If the inner loop completes without encountering the above condition, increment 'ans' to 'count' the clip being used and update 'end' to the new value of 
   'farthest'.

7. Finally, return the value of 'ans', which represents the minimum number of clips required to cover the entire time interval.


The algorithm effectively selects clips in a greedy manner, always choosing the clip that extends farthest, until it covers the entire time interval or determines 
that it's not possible. This approach ensures that the minimum number of clips needed to cover the time interval is found.
