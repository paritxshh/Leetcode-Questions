This Java code defines a class 'Solution' with a method 'sellingWood' that calculates the maximum money that can be obtained by cutting a piece of wood into 
smaller pieces and selling them based on their dimensions and prices. 

The function takes three parameters: 'm' (width of the wood), 'n' (height of the wood), and 'prices', which is a 2D array representing the prices for different 
dimensions of wood pieces.

Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

1. Initialize a 2D array 'dp' with dimensions '(m+1) x (n+1)' to store the maximum money for each possible wood piece dimension.
   - 'dp[i][j]' represents the maximum money that can be obtained by cutting a wood piece of size 'i x j'.

2. Loop through the 'prices' array and populate the 'dp' array with the prices for the given wood piece dimensions.
   - For each entry 'p' in 'prices', set 'dp[p[0]][p[1]]' to the corresponding price 'p[2]'.
  
3. Use dynamic programming to calculate the maximum money for each possible wood piece dimension by iterating through the dimensions '(i, j)' from
   '(1, 1)' to '(m, n)'.

4. For each dimension '(i, j)', consider all possible ways to cut the wood piece.
   - The code uses two nested loops to iterate through possible heights 'h' and widths 'w' within the current dimension.
   - It calculates the maximum money by considering the combination of cutting horizontally and vertically.

5. Update 'dp[i][j]' with the maximum money obtained from the current dimension and compare it with the maximum money obtained from previous dimensions.

6. Finally, the function returns the maximum money that can be obtained for the original wood piece size '(m, n)', which is stored in 'dp[m][n]'.


This code uses dynamic programming to find the optimal way to cut the wood and maximize the profit. By considering all possible combinations of cuts, it ensures 
that the algorithm explores all potential solutions to find the best one.
