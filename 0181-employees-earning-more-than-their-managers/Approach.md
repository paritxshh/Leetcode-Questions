Here's a step-by-step approach to solving the "Employees Earning More Than Their Managers" problem on LeetCode:

1. Understand the Schema and Problem Requirements:
   - Review the problem statement to understand the structure of the database schema and the specific requirements of the problem.
   - Identify the relevant columns in the "Employee" table, such as "Id," "Name," "Salary," and "ManagerId."

2. Use a Self-Join:
   - Perform a self-join on the "Employee" table to connect employees with their respective managers.
   - Use aliases to distinguish between the employee and manager instances of the table.
  
3. Compare Salaries:
   - In the WHERE clause of your query, compare the salary of each employee (E1.Salary) with the salary of their respective manager (E2.Salary).

4. Retrieve Employee Names:
   - Use the SELECT statement to retrieve the names of employees who earn more than their managers.
   - Use the alias of the employee instance to select the name (E1.Name).

5. Putting It All Together:
   - Write the SQL query combining the above steps.


Here's the complete SQL query based on the approach described:

" SELECT E1.Name AS Employee
  FROM Employee E1
  JOIN Employee E2 ON E1.ManagerId = E2.Id
  WHERE E1.Salary > E2.Salary; "

This query will return the names of employees who earn more than their managers.
