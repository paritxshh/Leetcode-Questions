â€‹This Java code defines a 'Solution' class with a method called 'countHighestScoreNodes'. This method takes an array 'parents' as input, which represents the parent
child relationships in a tree. The goal of the code is to find the nodes in the tree that have the highest "score" and count how many such nodes exist.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. Initialize a 'List<Integer>[] array' called 'tree' to represent the tree structure. Each element of this array will be a list of children for a specific node in 
   the tree.

2. Populate the 'tree' array based on the 'parents' array. For each element 'parents[i]' in the parents array, if it is not equal to -1 (indicating the root node), 
   add the node 'i' as a child of its parent node 'parents[i]'.

3. Initialize two private variables, 'ans' and 'maxScore', to keep track of the count of nodes with the highest score and the maximum score encountered so far, 
   respectively.

4. Call the 'dfs' (Depth-First Search) method with the 'tree' and 'root' node 0. The 'dfs' method performs a depth-first traversal of the tree and calculates the 
   score for each node.

5. Inside the 'dfs' method:
   - Initialize 'count' to 1 (count of nodes in the subtree rooted at u) and 'score' to 1 (the score for the subtree rooted at u).
   - Iterate through the children 'v' of node 'u'. For each child, recursively call the 'dfs' method to get the count of nodes in its subtree (childCount) and 
     update 'count' and 'score' accordingly.
   - Calculate the number of nodes above the current subtree as 'aboveCount' (the total number of nodes minus the count of nodes in the current subtree).
   - Update score by multiplying it by 'Math.max(aboveCount, 1)'. This step is related to the scoring mechanism used in the code.
   - Compare 'score' with the 'maxScore'.
       - If 'score' is greater than 'maxScore', update 'maxScore' and reset 'ans' to 1.
       - If 'score' is equal to 'maxScore', increment 'ans' to account for another node with the same maximum score.

6. Finally, the countHighestScoreNodes method returns the value of ans, which represents the count of nodes with the highest score in the tree.
