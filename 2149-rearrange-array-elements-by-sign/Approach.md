This code defines a Java class named 'Solution' that contains a method 'rearrangeArray'. 
  - This method takes an integer array 'nums' as input and returns a new integer array 'ans' where the positive and negative elements of the input array are 
    rearranged in an alternating manner.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

1. Create an integer array 'ans' with the same length as the input array 'nums'. This array will store the rearranged elements.

2. Create two ArrayLists, 'pos' and 'neg', to store positive and negative elements separately.

3. Iterate through each element 'num' in the input array 'nums' using an enhanced 'for' loop (for (final int num : nums)).

4. Check if the current element 'num' is greater than 0.
   - If it is positive, add it to the pos 'ArrayList'; otherwise, add it to the neg 'ArrayList'. This step essentially segregates positive and negative elements.

5. After segregating the elements, loop through the 'pos' ArrayList using a regular 'for' loop, where 'i' is the index.
   - For each index 'i', place the element at index 'i' from the 'pos' ArrayList into the 'ans' array at index 'i * 2' and place the element at the same index 'i' 
      from the 'neg' ArrayList into the 'ans' array at index 'i * 2 + 1'.

6. Return the 'ans' array containing the rearranged elements.


The approach here separates positive and negative elements into two ArrayLists and then alternates between placing positive and negative elements from those lists into the final 'ans' array. The logic assumes that there are an equal number of positive and negative elements in the input array. If the assumption is not met, this code might not produce the desired result.
