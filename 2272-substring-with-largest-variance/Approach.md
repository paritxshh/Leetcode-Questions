This code defines a Java class Solution with a method 'largestVariance' and a helper method 'kadane' to find the largest variance in a string 's' by replacing two 
different characters 'a' and 'b'. 

Here's an explanation of how this code works:

1. 'largestVariance' Method:
   - The 'largestVariance' method takes a string 's' as input and aims to find the largest variance by replacing two different characters 'a' and 'b' in the string.
   - It initializes a variable 'ans' to store the maximum variance found, starting with '0'.
   - It then iterates through all possible pairs of characters 'a' and 'b' using nested loops.
   - Inside the nested loops, it calls the 'kadane' method with characters 'a' and 'b' as arguments to calculate the variance for these two characters.
   - It updates the 'ans' variable with the maximum variance found across all pairs of 'a' and 'b'.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum variance found.

2. 'kadane' Method:
   - The 'kadane' method takes three arguments: the input string 's' and two characters 'a' and 'b'.
   - It is used to calculate the variance when replacing characters 'a' with 'b' in the input string.
   - It initializes variables 'ans' (to store the maximum variance), 'countA' (to count occurrences of character 'a'), 'countB' (to count occurrences of character 
     'b'), and 'canExtendPrevB' (a flag to indicate if a 'b' can extend a previous interval).
   - It iterates through each character in the input string 's' using a 'for-each' loop.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the current character 'c' is equal to 'a' or 'b'. If it's neither of them, it continues to the next character.
   - Depending on whether 'c' is 'a' or 'b', it increments the corresponding count ('countA' or 'countB').
   - If 'countB' is greater than '0', it means there is at least one 'b' in the current interval. In this case, it calculates the variance by subtracting 'countB' 
     from 'countA' and updates 'ans' if the calculated variance is greater than the current 'ans'.
   - If 'countB' is '0', but 'canExtendPrevB' is true, it considers the previous 'b' and calculates the variance by subtracting '1' from 'countA'. This is an edge 
     case for the situation where 'a' follows 'b'.
   - If at any point 'countB' becomes greater than 'countA', it means that 'b' has occurred more times than 'a' in the current interval, and it resets the counts 
     and sets 'canExtendPrevB' to true to indicate that the next 'b' can extend the previous interval.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum variance 'ans' calculated for the given characters 'a' and 'b' in the string 's'.


The largestVariance method explores all possible pairs of 'a' and 'b' and calculates the variance using the kadane method. It returns the maximum variance found 
across all pairs.
