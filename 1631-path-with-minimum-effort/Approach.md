â€‹This code is an implementation of a solution to find the minimum effort path in a 2D grid of heights. The goal is to start from the top-left corner of the grid 
'(position 0,0)' and reach the bottom-right corner '(position m-1, n-1)' with the minimum possible effort, where effort is defined as the maximum absolute 
difference in heights between adjacent cells along the path.

Here's a breakdown of the approach:

1. The 'T' class is defined to represent a cell in the grid with its coordinates 'i' and 'j', and the maximum difference 'd' of its neighbors.

2. The 'minimumEffortPath' function takes a 2D array 'heights' as input, where 'heights[i][j]' represents the height of cell '(i, j)'.

3. Initialize variables:
   - Dimensions of the grid '(m and n)'.
   - 'dirs' array to represent four possible directions to move '(up, right, down, left)'.
   - Min-heap 'minHeap' to store cells sorted by their maximum difference 'd'.
   - 2D array 'diff' to store the maximum difference to reach each cell.
   - 'seen' array to keep track of visited cells.

4. Initialize the starting cell '(0,0)' in the min-heap with a maximum difference of '0', as there is no difference to reach the starting cell.

5. Perform a modified Dijkstra's algorithm using the min-heap:
   - While the min-heap is not empty:
       - Get the cell with the smallest maximum difference from the min-heap.
       - If this cell is the destination (bottom-right corner), return its maximum difference as the answer.
       - Mark the current cell as seen.
       - Iterate through the four possible directions to move and calculate the new maximum difference for each neighbor cell.
       - If the new maximum difference is smaller than the maximum difference recorded in the diff array for the neighbor cell, update the diff array and add the 
         neighbor cell to the min-heap with the new maximum difference.

6. If the loop completes without finding a path to the destination, throw an 'IllegalArgumentException' because there is no valid path.


In summary, this code uses a modified Dijkstra's algorithm to find the minimum effort path in the grid, where effort is defined as the maximum absolute difference 
in heights between adjacent cells along the path. It starts from the top-left corner and iteratively explores cells with the minimum effort, updating the maximum 
difference needed to reach each cell.
