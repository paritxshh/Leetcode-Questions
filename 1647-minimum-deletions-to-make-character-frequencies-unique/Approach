This code defines a Java class 'Solution' that aims to find the minimum number of deletions required in a string 's' such that no two distinct characters have the 
same frequency. In other words, the goal is to make the frequencies of all characters in the string unique by removing as few characters as possible.

Here's a breakdown of the approach used in the code:

1. Initialize variables:
  - 'ans': To keep track of the number of deletions required.
  - 'count': An array of size 26 to store the frequency of each lowercase English letter ('a' to 'z').
  - 'usedfreq': A set to store frequencies that have already been encountered.

2. Loop through the characters of the input string s and populate the 'count' array:
  - Increment the count of the character at its corresponding index in the 'count' array (e.g., 'a' - 'a' = 0, 'b' - 'a' = 1, and so on).

3. Iterate through the count array:
  - For each frequency 'freq', check if it's greater than zero and whether it's already present in the usedFreq set.
  - If it is, decrement 'freq', indicating that we are removing a character to decrease its frequency.
  - Increment the 'ans' counter to keep track of the number of deletions made.

4. After processing a frequency, add it to the 'usedfreq' set to mark that this frequency has been used.

5. Finally, return the 'ans' which represents the minimum number of deletions required to achieve the desired condition.


This approach ensures that you're trying to maintain unique frequencies for each character while minimizing the number of deletions needed. It iterates through the character counts and, whenever it encounters a frequency that has already been used, it decrements the frequency and increments the 'ans' counter to account for the character deletion.
