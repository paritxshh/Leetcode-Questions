â€‹This code is a Java implementation of a solution to the "Maximum Length of Pair Chain" problem. This problem is a variation of the classic "Activity Selection" 
problem and can be solved using a greedy approach. The goal is to find the maximum number of non-overlapping pairs from an array of pairs (where each pair represents 
a start and end point), such that the second element of each pair is strictly greater than the first element of the next pair.

Here's a breakdown of the code and the approach it uses:

1. Initialization:
   - 'ans': A variable to store the length of the maximum chain of pairs.
   - 'prevEnd': A variable to keep track of the end value of the previously selected pair.
       - Initialized to a very small value ('Integer.MIN_VALUE') to ensure that the first pair is selected.

2. Sorting:
   - The array of pairs ('int[][] pairs') is sorted based on the second element of each pair ('a[1] - b[1]').
   - Sorting by the second element ensures that pairs with smaller end points come first. This is a crucial step for the greedy approach.

3. Greedy Selection:
   - The sorted array is traversed using a for-each loop.
   - For each pair in the sorted array:
       - If the starting value of the current pair ('pair[0]') is greater than the end value of the previously selected pair ('prevEnd'), it means the current pair 
          can be included in the chain without overlapping with the previous pair.
       - In this case, the 'ans' variable is incremented by 1 to indicate that a new pair has been added to the chain.
       - The 'prevEnd' is updated to the end value of the current pair ('pair[1]').

4. Return:
   - After iterating through all pairs, the value of 'ans' represents the maximum length of the pair chain that can be formed without overlapping.


The code relies on the greedy approach because by selecting pairs with smaller end values first, there's a higher chance of finding room for more non-overlapping pairs in the chain.

This approach works because the pairs are sorted by their end values, ensuring that if a pair is selected, it has the potential to accommodate as many subsequent pairs as possible without overlaps. The greedy choice of always selecting the pair with the smallest end value that doesn't overlap with the previously selected pair leads to an optimal solution for this problem.
