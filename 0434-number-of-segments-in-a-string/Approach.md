Here's a breakdown of the approach used in the Java solution for the LeetCode problem 434 - Number of Segments in a String:

1. Create a variable count and set its initial value to reflect the number of segments.

2. Use a for loop to repeatedly iterate over each character in the input string s:
   - for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++)

3. Check to see if the character you are currently reading is not a space and if either the first character in the string or the character before it was a space:
   - if (s.charAt(i) != ' ' && (i == 0 || s.charAt(i - 1) == ' ')) {
    count++;
	}

   - Here's what's happening in this condition:
     - s.charAt(i) != ' ' : The current character is checked to make sure it is not a space. We have come across a new word segment if there isn't a space.
     - (i == 0 || s.charAt(i - 1) == ' ') : This portion of the condition determines if the current character is the first one in the string (i == 0) or if a space 	was present before the current character (s.charAt(i - 1) ==''). A new word segment begins with the current character if either of these circumstances is 	true.

4. Every time a new word segment is encountered, increase the count.

5. Return the final value of count as the number of segments in the string after going through the entire string.


This method works by recognising word segments based on spaces and the requirements stated in step 3. Every time a new segment is discovered, the count is increased as the programme loops through the string's characters. The total number of segments in the input string is the result.
