By iterating through the input arrays of release timings and pressed keys and keeping track of the slowest key based on the longest interval between consecutive key presses, the LeetCode issue 1629 "Slowest Key" can be solved.

1. Initialize variables to keep track of the maximum duration and the corresponding slowest key:
   - maxDuration: Initialize it with the duration between the first two release times (releaseTimes[0]).
   - slowestKey: Initialize it with the key pressed corresponding to the first release time (keysPressed.charAt(0)).

2. Loop through the arrays from the second element (index 1) to the end:
   - Calculate the duration between the current release time and the previous release time: duration = releaseTimes[i] - releaseTimes[i - 1].
   - Check if the current duration is greater than maxDuration or if it's equal to maxDuration but the current key pressed is lexicographically larger than 		slowestKey.
   - If the above condition is met, update maxDuration with the current duration and update slowestKey with the current key pressed.

3. After the loop completes, slowestKey will contain the answer.
   
4. Return the value of slowestKey.

In conclusion, the method compares the time between successive key presses as it iterates through the input arrays, changing the slowest key whenever a larger period is reached. When two keys have the same duration but different lexical sizes, the slower key is determined by its size. This method makes sure that the slowest key is found using the specified criteria.
