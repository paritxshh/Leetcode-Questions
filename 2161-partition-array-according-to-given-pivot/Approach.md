â€‹This code defines a Java class Solution with a method pivotArray that takes an array of integers nums and an integer pivot as input. 
  - The goal of the method is to rearrange the elements in the nums array such that all elements less than pivot appear before pivot, and all elements greater than 
    pivot appear after pivot. 
  - The relative order of the elements within each group is not preserved.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the approach:

1. Create a new integer array ans with the same length as the input array nums. This array will store the rearranged elements.

2. Initialize an index i to 0. This index keeps track of the current position in the ans array where the next element should be inserted.

3. Loop through each element num in the nums array using a foreach loop.

4. In the first loop, for each element num that is less than pivot, insert it into the ans array at index i and then increment i.
   - This places all elements less than pivot at the beginning of the ans array.

5. In the second loop, for each element 'num' that is equal to 'pivot', insert it into the 'ans' array at index 'i' and then increment i.
   - This step ensures that all occurrences of the pivot value are placed right after the elements less than 'pivot'.

6. In the third loop, for each element 'num that is greater than 'pivot', insert it into the 'ans' array at index 'i' and then increment i.
   - This places all elements greater than 'pivot' at the end of the 'ans' array.

7. After all three loops, the 'ans' array will contain the rearranged elements as per the desired order.

8. Return the 'ans' array as the final output.
