â€‹This Java code is an implementation of a solution to remove duplicates from a sorted array while allowing at most two duplicates to remain. The function takes 
an array of integers 'nums' as input and returns an integer representing the length of the modified array where at most two duplicates are allowed for each element.

Here's a breakdown of the approach used in this code:

1. Initialize a variable 'i' to 0. This variable will be used to keep track of the current position where non-duplicate elements are stored in the modified array.

2. Iterate through the elements of the 'nums' array using a 'for' loop, where each element is represented by 'num'.

3. Inside the loop, there is an 'if' condition that checks whether the current element 'num' is either less than two occurrences or greater than the element two 
   positions back in the modified array '(nums[i - 2])'. This condition effectively checks if the current element is allowed to be included in the modified array.
   - If 'i' is less than 2, it means the first two elements in the 'nums' array are automatically allowed since we want to allow at most two duplicates.
   - If 'num' is greater than the element two positions back '(nums[i - 2])', it means it's not a duplicate (or it's the first occurrence of the third unique 
     element), so it's allowed.

4. If the condition in step 3 is met, the current element 'num' is stored in the modified array at the position 'nums[i]', and 'i' is incremented by 1 to move to the 
     next position in the modified array.

5. Repeat steps 3-4 for all elements in the 'nums' array.

6. Finally, return the value of 'i', which represents the length of the modified array.
