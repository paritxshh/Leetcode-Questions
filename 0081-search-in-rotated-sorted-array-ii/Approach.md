â€‹This Java code defines a class called 'Solution' that contains a method named 'search'. This method is designed to search for a target value in a rotated sorted 
array (also known as a rotated sorted array). The approach used in this code is a modified binary search algorithm to find the target element efficiently in the 
given array.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the approach:

1. Initialize two pointers, 'l' and 'r', to the beginning and end of the array, respectively. These pointers represent the current search range.

2. Enter a 'while' loop that continues as long as 'l' is less than or equal to 'r'. This loop iteratively narrows down the search range until the 'target' is found 
   or the search range becomes empty.

3. Calculate the middle index 'm' as the average of 'l' and 'r'. This is done to check the middle element of the current search range.

4. Check if the middle element 'nums[m]' is equal to the 'target'. If it is, return 'true' because the 'target' has been found.

5. Handle the case when 'nums[l]' is equal to 'nums[m]' and 'nums[m]' is equal to 'nums[r]'.
   - This situation occurs when there are duplicates in the array at both ends.
   - In such cases, it is not clear whether the left or right subarray is sorted, so you increment 'l' and decrement 'r' to narrow down the search range.

6. Check if the left subarray 'nums[l..m]' is sorted. If it is, then check whether the 'target' falls within this sorted subarray.
   - If the 'target' is in this subarray, update 'r' to 'm - 1' to search the left half.
   - Otherwise, update 'l' to 'm + 1' to search the right half.

7. If the left subarray is not sorted, it means that the right subarray 'nums[m..r]' is sorted. Check whether the target falls within this sorted subarray.
   - If the target is in this subarray, update 'l' to 'm + 1' to search the right half.
   - Otherwise, update 'r' to 'm - 1' to search the left half.

8. Repeat steps 3-7 until the search range is narrowed down to an empty range '(l > r)'.

9. If the loop completes without finding the 'target', return 'false' to indicate that the 'target' is not in the array.
