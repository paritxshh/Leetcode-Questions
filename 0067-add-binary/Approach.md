Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach used in the Java code for adding binary numbers:

1. Declare the two binary strings you want to add and define the input binary strings.

2. Create a result StringBuilder and set its initial values to store the total amount.

3. Set an integer variable named carry to 0 to initialise it. The carry value will be tracked throughout addition in this way.

4. From the least significant bit to the most significant bit, begin iterating through both input binary strings starting on the right.

5. Calculate Sum for Current Digits:
   - From the input strings, compute the sum for the current bits as well as the carry for each iteration.

6. Update Indices:
   - To move to the next higher bit, lower the indices for both input strings (i for the first string and j for the second string).

7. Calculate Remainder and Carry:
   - Determine the amount's balance after being divided by two. This will serve as the result's current bit. Divide the sum by 2 to update the carry.

8. Insert Bit into Result:
   - Start the result StringBuilder with the calculated remainder (current bit).

9. Continue Iterating:
    - Continue iterating until all of the bits in both input strings have been processed.

10. Add Remaining Carry:
    - If any carry is left over after the iteration, add it at the start of the output StringBuilder.

11. Return Result:
    - Use toString() to transform the result StringBuilder into a string and return the final binary sum.


This method works because it handles carrying over to the next bit when necessary, mimicking the manual addition process you would use to add binary numbers by hand.
