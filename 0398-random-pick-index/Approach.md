This Java code is implementing a method for picking a random index from an array of integers ('nums') that match a given 'target' value. The purpose of this class 
might be related to a problem where you want to randomly select an index from the array where the value matches the target.

Here's a breakdown of the approach:

1. The constructor 'Solution(int[] nums)' takes an array of integers 'nums' as an argument and initializes the private 'nums' field with it.

2. The pick 'int target' method takes a 'target' integer as an argument and returns an index from the 'nums' array where the value matches the 'target'. If no such 
    index is found, it returns -1.

3. Inside the pick method:
   - 'ans' is the variable that will store the selected index. It is initialized to -1.
   - 'range' is the number of elements found in the array so far that match the target value.

4. A loop iterates through each element in the nums array. If the current element is equal to the target value:
   - 'rand.nextInt(++range) == 0' generates a random integer between 0 (inclusive) and the current value of 'range' (exclusive). This effectively gives each matching 
      element an equal probability of being chosen.
   -  If the generated random number is 0, then the current index 'i' is selected as the potential answer 'ans'.

5. After the loop finishes, the selected index 'ans' is returned. If no matching element was found, the value of -1 (initialized value) will be returned.

6. The 'nums' array and the 'rand' object are private fields of the class, ensuring that they are accessible only within the class.
