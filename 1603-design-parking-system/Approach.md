The approach used in the provided solution is quite straightforward and efficient:

1. Initialization:
   - The number of parking spaces available for each car type (large, medium, and small) is stored in an integer array count in the ParkingSystem class' constructor.

2. Parking a Vehicle:
   - The code determines whether slots of that type are available when the addCar method is called with a specific carType.
   - In order to accomplish this, it decreases the count for the relevant car type and determines whether the count is greater than or equal to 0.
   - If so, it indicates that a slot is open, and the method returns true; if not, it returns false.


This method is straightforward and effective because it uses the slot counts directly to determine whether a specific type of car can be parked. It's a great illustration of how to use data structures and array manipulation to creatively solve problems.
