â€‹This Java code defines a class 'Solution' that contains a method 'minExtraChar'. This method takes two parameters: a string 's' and an array of strings 
'dictionary'. 
The goal of this method is to find the minimum number of extra characters that need to be added to the string 's' in order to make it composed entirely of words 
from the 'dictionary'.

Here's how the code works:

1. It initializes some variables:
   - 'n' is the length of the input string s.
   - 'dictionarySet' is a HashSet that stores the words from the 'dictionary' array. This data structure allows for efficient word lookup.

2. It initializes an integer array 'dp' of length n + 1 and fills it with the value 'n'. This array will be used for dynamic programming to store the minimum 
   number of extra characters needed to construct the substring ending at index 'i'.

3. It sets 'dp[0]' to 0 because no extra characters are needed to construct an empty string.

4. The code then enters a nested loop with two variables 'i' and 'j', where 'i' represents the end of the substring being considered, and 'j' represents the start 
   of the substring.

5. For each combination of 'i' and 'j', it checks whether the substring from 'j' to 'i' is present in the 'dictionarySet' (i.e., it's a valid word).
   - If it's a valid word, it updates 'dp[i]' to be the minimum of its current value and 'dp[j]'.
   - This means that if you can form the substring from 'j' to 'i' using words from the dictionary, you don't need any extra characters.

6. If the substring from 'j' to 'i' is not a valid word, it means you need to add characters to form it. In this case, it updates 'dp[i]' to be the minimum of its 
   current value and 'dp[j] + (i - j)'. This means that you need to add 'i - j' extra characters to the substring formed by extending the substring from 'j' to 'i'.

7. Finally, the method returns 'dp[n]', which represents the minimum number of extra characters needed to form the entire input string 's' using words from the 
  'dictionary'.
