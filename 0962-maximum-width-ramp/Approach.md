â€‹The given code is a Java solution to find the maximum width ramp in an array. A ramp is defined as a pair of indices (i, j) where i < j and nums[i] <= nums[j]. The maximum width of a ramp is the difference between j and i in the pair that gives the maximum difference.

Here's a breakdown of the approach used in the code:

1. Initialize a variable ans to store the maximum width of the ramp.

2. Create a Deque (double-ended queue) named stack to keep track of indices while iterating through the array.

3. First Loop:
   - Iterate through the array nums using the index i.
   - If the stack is empty or the current element nums[i] is less than the element at the index stored at the top of the stack, push the current index i onto the           stack.
   - This loop essentially keeps track of the indices of elements in a decreasing order. The idea is to find the smallest value from the left side of the array for         each element.

4. Second Loop:
   - Iterate through the array nums in reverse order, starting from the last index nums.length - 1.
   - While the stack is not empty and the current element nums[i] is greater than or equal to the element at the index stored at the top of the stack:
   - Update the ans by taking the maximum of ans and the difference between the current index i and the index obtained from popping the top of the stack.
   - This loop is used to find the largest difference (maximum width) between the current element and any smaller element on its right side.

5. After both loops are done, the variable ans holds the maximum width of the ramp.

6. Return the value of ans as the final result.


n summary, this solution iterates through the array twice. In the first iteration, it constructs a stack of indices with elements in decreasing order. In the second iteration, it processes the stack to find the maximum width of the ramp. The stack is used to efficiently keep track of potential candidates for forming ramps, allowing the algorithm to find the maximum width ramp efficiently.

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(N) where N is the number of elements in the input array, as each element is pushed and popped from the stack at most once. The space complexity is also O(N) due to the space used by the stack.
