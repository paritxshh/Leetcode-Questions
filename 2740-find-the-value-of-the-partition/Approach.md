â€‹This Java code defines a class 'Solution' with a single method 'findValueOfPartition'. This method takes an array of integers 'nums' as input and returns an integer 
as its output. The goal of this method is to find the smallest absolute difference between any two adjacent elements in the sorted version of the input array.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. 'int ans = Integer.MAX_VALUE': Initializes a variable 'ans' to the maximum possible integer value, which will be used to keep track of the minimum absolute 
    difference.

2. 'Arrays.sort(nums)': Sorts the input array 'nums' in ascending order. Sorting the array is necessary to ensure that adjacent elements in the array are in 
    ascending order so that we can calculate the absolute differences between them.

3. The 'for' loop iterates through the sorted array starting from the second element (index 1) up to the last element.

4. Inside the loop, 'ans' is updated using 'ans = Math.min(ans, nums[i] - nums[i - 1])'. This line calculates the absolute difference between the current element 
   'nums[i]' and the previous element 'nums[i - 1]' and updates the 'ans' variable to store the minimum absolute difference encountered so far.

5. Finally, the method returns the value stored in the 'ans' variable, which represents the smallest absolute difference between adjacent elements in the sorted 
   array.


In summary, this code efficiently finds the smallest absolute difference between any two adjacent elements in the input array by first sorting the array and then 
calculating the differences between adjacent elements in a loop, keeping track of the minimum difference encountered.
