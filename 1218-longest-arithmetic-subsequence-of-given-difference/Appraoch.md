â€‹This code is a Java implementation of a solution to find the length of the longest subsequence in an array 'arr' such that the difference between any two 
consecutive elements in the subsequence is equal to the given 'difference'.

Here's how the algorithm works:

1. Initialize 'ans' to 0. This variable will keep track of the length of the longest subsequence found.

2. Create a HashMap called 'lengthAt' to store the length of subsequences ending at a particular element.

3. Iterate through the elements in the 'arr' array.

4. For each element 'a' in the array, calculate the length of the subsequence ending at 'a' by looking up a - difference in the 'lengthAt' HashMap.
   - If there is no such entry in the 'HashMap', default to 0.

5. Update the length of the subsequence ending at 'a' in the 'lengthAt' HashMap by incrementing the length by 1.

6. Update the 'ans' variable to keep track of the maximum length found so far.

7. Continue the loop until all elements in the 'arr' array are processed.

8. Finally, return the value stored in the 'ans' variable, which represents the length of the longest subsequence with the given difference.
