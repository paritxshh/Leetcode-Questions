â€‹This code is an implementation of a dynamic programming approach to solve the "Perfect Squares" problem, which is a classic problem in computer science and 
mathematics. The problem statement is as follows:

Given a positive integer 'n', find the least number of perfect square numbers (1, 4, 9, 16, ...) that sum up to 'n'.

Let's break down the approach used in the code:

1. Initialize an array 'dp' of size 'n+1' to store the minimum number of perfect square numbers needed to sum up to each value from 0 to n.
   - Initialize all elements in the array to a large value 'n', except for 'dp[0]' which is set to 0 (since 0 can be formed using 0 perfect squares) and 'dp[1]'   
      which is set to 1 (as 1 is itself a perfect square).

2. Iterate from '2 to n' in the outer loop. For each value 'i', the goal is to find the minimum number of perfect square numbers needed to sum up to i.

3. In the inner loop, iterate over all possible perfect square numbers less than or equal to 'i'. For each 'j', where 'j * j <= i', calculate the potential number 
   of perfect squares needed to sum up to 'i' if we consider using 'j * j' as one of the perfect squares in the sum.

4. Update 'dp[i]' with the minimum between its current value and 'dp[i - j * j] + 1'. This is because 'dp[i - j * j]' represents the minimum number of perfect 
   squares needed to sum up to the remainder of i after subtracting 'j * j', and by adding one more perfect square '(j * j)', we get the minimum number of perfect 
   squares needed to sum up to 'i'.

5. After the loops, 'dp[n]' will store the minimum number of perfect square numbers needed to sum up to 'n', which is the desired result.

6. Return 'dp[n]'.


The idea behind this approach is to build the solution incrementally by considering all possible combinations of perfect squares that sum up to a given number. By 
keeping track of the minimum number of squares needed for each value, the algorithm ensures that the solution is built optimally.
