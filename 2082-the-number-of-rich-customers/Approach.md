In this code, I'll walk you through the SQL query that helps us count the number of unique customers who have spent more than $500 at our store. 

Let's break down the approach step by step:

1. SELECT Statement:
   - We start by using the SELECT statement to retrieve data from our database.

2. COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id):
   - The COUNT function is used to count the number of rows that match the specified condition. In this case, we want to count the distinct (unique) customer_id           values.

3. As rich_count:
   - We use the AS keyword to give a more meaningful name to the result of our count operation. This result will be named rich_count.

4. FROM Store:
   - We specify the table Store from which we want to retrieve the data.

5. WHERE amount > 500:
   - The WHERE clause is used to filter the rows that meet a specific condition. Here, we're interested in customers whose amount spent is greater than $500.
  

This query calculates the count of unique customers who have spent more than $500, providing us with insights into the number of high-spending customers. This simple yet powerful SQL analysis can assist in making informed business decisions.
