This Java code defines a class called 'Solution' with a method 'countVowels' that calculates the sum of the number of vowels in different substrings of a given word. 
The approach used here is dynamic programming to efficiently compute these sums. 

Let's break down the code step by step:

1. The 'countVowels' method takes a single argument, a String named 'word', and returns a long value.

2. Inside the method, an array 'dp' of type long is created. The size of this array is set to 'word.length() + 1', which allows it to store the cumulative sum of 
   vowels for substrings of different lengths.

3. The main loop iterates from 'i = 1' to 'i <= word.length()'. Inside the loop:
   - 'dp[i]' is initialized with the value of 'dp[i - 1]', which represents the sum of vowels in the substring word'[:i-1]'.
   - If the character at position 'i - 1' in the word (character at index 'i - 1') is a vowel (as determined by the 'isVowel' method), then 'i' is added to 'dp[i]'.
   - This step accumulates the count of vowels in the current substring.

4. Finally, the code returns the sum of all elements in the 'dp' array using 'Arrays.stream(dp).sum()'. This sum represents the total count of vowels in all possible 
   substrings of the input word.


The 'isVowel' method is a helper function that checks if a given character 'c' is a vowel by searching for it in the string "aeiou". If the character is found in 
this string, the method returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

In summary, this code efficiently calculates the sum of vowel counts in all possible substrings of a given word using dynamic programming.
