This code establishes the 'Solution' Java class, which includes the'mergeArrays' method. This technique combines and summarises the pairs of integers in the two-dimensional arrays "nums1" and "nums2." A value and an identifier (id) make up each pair. The code seeks to join pairings that share an identifier and add the values assigned to each pair. The result is a collection of arrays, each inner array containing an identification and its total value.

Let's outline the strategy in detail:

1. Set Up Variables:
   -'max': This is set to 1000, which is the largest identifier value that may be used. The code expects that the input arrays' IDs fall between 1 and 1000.
   -'soln' is an ArrayList of integer arrays. The combined and summarised pairings will be stored.
   -'count': This is an array of integers with a size of'maxIterate + 1'. The total values for each identifier will be kept there.

2. The 'addCount' Method: An integer array called "count" and a two-dimensional array named "nums" are the two inputs this private function accepts.
   - The 'nums' array's pairs are iterated over one by one.
   - It extracts the value ('val') and identifier ('id') for each pair.
   - It increases the value ('val') in the 'count' array at the index corresponding to the identifier ('count[id]').

3. The'mergeArrays' function accepts two two-dimensional arrays, 'nums1' and 'nums2', as inputs.
   - The before described initializations of "soln" and "count" are made.

4. Calling the 'addCount':
   The "addCount" function is then invoked twice, with the "nums1" and "nums2" arrays being sent together with the "count" array. The total of values for              each identifier across the two input arrays is filled into the 'count' array in this stage.
   - After that, a loop is used to iterate from 1 to "max" (inclusive).
   - If the value of the 'count' array at index 'i' for a given identifier ('i') is greater than 0, then there exist pairings that share that identifier. As a           result, it takes the identifier 'i' from the array 'count' and constructs a new integer array called 'count[i]' that is added to the 'soln'.
  
5. The 'toArray' function is then used to transform the 'outputArray' into a two-dimensional integer array, and the combined and summarised data is returned.
