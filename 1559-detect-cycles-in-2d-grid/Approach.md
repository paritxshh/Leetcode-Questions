This code defines a class Solution with a method containsCycle that aims to determine whether there is a cycle within a given 2D grid of characters. The grid is 
represented as a char[][] where each cell contains a character. The goal is to check if there's a cycle of the same character where you can move from a cell to its 
adjacent cell in four directions (up, down, left, right).

The approach followed by the code can be explained step by step:

1. The method containsCycle takes a 2D character grid as input and initializes a boolean array seen of the same dimensions as the grid.
   - This array is used to keep track of whether a cell has been visited during the DFS traversal.

2. The method iterates through all cells in the grid using nested loops over i and j indices.

3. For each cell (i, j), if it has already been seen (i.e., seen[i][j] is true), the code continues to the next cell.

4. If the cell (i, j) hasn't been seen yet, the dfs method is called to perform a depth-first search starting from this cell.
   - The parameters provided to dfs include the grid, current cell indices (i, j), previous cell indices (prevI, prevJ), the character in the current cell c, and 
      the seen array.

5. Inside the dfs method, the current cell (i, j) is marked as seen by setting seen[i][j] to true.

6. The method then loops through the four possible directions (up, right, down, left) using the dir array.
   - For each direction, it calculates the new cell indices (x, y) by adding the corresponding offsets to the current indices (i, j).

7. If the new indices (x, y) fall outside the bounds of the grid (i.e., x is negative, x is equal to the number of rows, y is negative, or y is equal to the number 
    of columns), the code continues to the next iteration of the loop.

8. If the new indices (x, y) are the same as the previous indices (prevI, prevJ), it means the current cell (i, j) was reached by backtracking, and the code 
    continues to the next iteration of the loop.

9. If the character in the new cell (x, y) is not the same as the character c in the current cell (i, j), the code continues to the next iteration of the loop.

10. If the new cell (x, y) has already been seen (seen[x][y] is true), it means a cycle has been found, and the method returns true.

11. If none of the above conditions are met, the dfs method is called recursively with the new cell indices (x, y) as well as the current cell indices (i, j) as 
    the previous cell indices. This continues the DFS traversal.

12. If the DFS traversal completes without finding a cycle, the method returns false.


In summary, this code employs a depth-first search approach to traverse the grid, checking for cycles of the same character. If a cycle is found during traversal, the method returns true; otherwise, it returns false.
