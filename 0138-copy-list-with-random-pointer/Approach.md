â€‹The provided code implements a solution to clone a linked list with both 'next' and 'random' pointers. This linked list is defined using the Node class, which has 
three fields: 'val', 'next', and 'random'.

Here's how the code works:

1. The 'copyRandomList' method is a recursive function that takes the 'head' of the original linked list as an argument and returns the corresponding 'head' of the 
   cloned linked list.

2. The base case is when 'head' is null, which means the end of the list has been reached, so it returns null.

3. Before creating a new node for the current head, it checks if the current head node has already been cloned by looking it up in the map.
   - If it has been cloned, it returns the cloned node from the 'map'. This ensures that nodes with the same reference are not duplicated in the cloned list.

4. If the current head node hasn't been cloned yet, a new node '(newNode)' is created with the same val as the original node.

5. The new node's next pointer is set to the result of recursively calling 'copyRandomList' on the 'head.next' node. This handles the cloning of the next pointers 
   in the linked list.

6. The new node's random pointer is set to the result of recursively calling 'copyRandomList' on the 'head.random' node. This handles the cloning of the random 
   pointers in the linked list.

7. The cloned 'newNode' is then stored in the map with the original 'head' as the key, ensuring that future encounters of the same head node will return the 
   already cloned node from the map.

8. Finally, the cloned 'newNode' is returned as the result of the current recursive call.

9. The 'map' is used to keep track of the original nodes and their corresponding cloned nodes to avoid duplicate work and prevent infinite loops in cases where 
   there are circular references.


This code effectively creates a deep copy of the linked list, including both the next and random pointers, and ensures that each node is only cloned once.
