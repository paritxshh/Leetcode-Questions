â€‹This Java code defines a 'Solution' class with a 'checkArray' method. This method takes an integer array 'nums' and an integer 'k' as input and returns a boolean 
value. It checks whether it's possible to make every element in the array non-negative by subtracting some value from each element, and if this is possible, it 
returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. If 'k' is equal to 1, it immediately returns true because in this case, no operations are required, and the array is already considered valid.

2. It initializes a variable 'needDecrease' to 0. This variable keeps track of the cumulative value that needs to be subtracted from the elements of the array to 
   make them non-negative.

3. It uses a deque ('Deque<Integer> dq') to store a sliding window of elements from the input array 'nums'. The window size is controlled by the value of 'k'. This 
   deque will help keep track of the sum of elements within the sliding window.

4. It iterates over the elements of the 'nums' array using a 'for' loop.

5. Inside the loop:
   - If 'i' is greater than or equal to 'k', it removes the first element from the deque and subtracts its value from 'needDecrease'.
   - This step ensures that the sliding window moves forward.
   - It checks whether the current element 'nums[i]' is less than 'needDecrease'.
   - If it is, it means that there's not enough cumulative value to make the current element non-negative, so it returns false.
   - It calculates 'decreasedNum' as the difference between the current element 'nums[i]' and 'needDecrease'.
   - This represents how much value needs to be subtracted from the current element to make it non-negative.
   - It adds 'decreasedNum' to the deque and updates 'needDecrease' by adding 'decreasedNum'. This step updates the sliding window's 'sum'.

6. After the loop completes, it checks whether the last element in the deque is equal to 0.
   - If it is, it means that all elements in the array can be made non-negative, and the method returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.


In summary, this code is checking if it's possible to make all elements in the array non-negative by subtracting a cumulative value from each element within a 
sliding window of size k. If it's possible, the method returns true; otherwise, it returns false.
