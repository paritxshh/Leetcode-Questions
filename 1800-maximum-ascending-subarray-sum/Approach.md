â€‹The approach to solving LeetCode problem 1800, "Maximum Ascending Subarray Sum," involves iterating through the given array and maintaining two variables: maxsum and 
currsum. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. Initialize 'maxsum' and 'currsum' to the first element of the array nums[0].

2. Iterate through the array from the second element to the last element.

3. For each element nums[i], compare it with the previous element nums[i - 1].

4. If nums[i] is greater than nums[i - 1], it means the ascending subarray continues, so add nums[i] to 'currsum'.

5. If nums[i] is not greater than nums[i - 1], the ascending subarray breaks.
   - Update 'maxsum' with the maximum value between 'maxsum' and 'currsum'.
   - Reset 'currsum' to the current element nums[i], as this could be the start of a new ascending subarray.

6. After iterating through the array, the final ascending subarray sum might extend till the last element.
   - Update 'maxsum' with the maximum value between 'maxsum' and 'currsum' again.

7. Return the maximum of 'maxsum' and 'currSum' as the result.


This approach works because it efficiently keeps track of the maximum ascending subarray sum while iterating through the array and handling cases where ascending subarrays are broken or continue. The key idea is to compare adjacent elements to identify whether the ascending order is maintained or not.
