â€‹This code defines a Java class Solution that implements a text justification algorithm using a greedy approach. 
  - This algorithm takes an array of words and a maximum width (maxWidth) as input and returns a list of strings representing the fully justified text.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach used in the code:

1. Initialize necessary variables:
   - ans: A list to store the final justified lines.
   - row: A list of StringBuilders to temporarily store words in the current row.
   - rowletters: A counter to keep track of the total number of letters in the current row.

2. Iterate through each word in the input words array:
   - If adding the current word to the current row would exceed the maxWidth, it means the current row is complete and needs to be justified.
       - Calculate the total number of spaces needed to justify the row (spaces).
       - Check if there's only one word in the row (row.size() == 1), in which case add spaces to the right of the word.
       - If there are multiple words in the row, distribute the spaces evenly between the words. The modulo operation is used to cycle through the words and add 
          spaces.
         
    - Join the words in the current row to form a single string without spaces (joinedrow).
    - Add the joinedrow to the ans list.
    - Clear the row list and reset rowletters to 0.

3. After processing all the words, there might be one last row left in the row list.
   - This row is not fully justified but still needs to be padded with spaces to the right.
   - Join the words in the last row using a single space separator (lastrow).
   - Create a new StringBuilder sb with the content of lastrow.
   - Calculate the number of spaces that need to be added to reach the maxWidth (spacestobeadded).
   - Append the required number of spaces to the sb.

4. Add the fully justified last row (sb.toString()) to the ans list.

5. Finally, return the ans list containing the fully justified text.


Note: This approach may not produce the optimal justification in all cases, and there might be alternative ways to solve the text justification problem. The code 
focuses on using a greedy approach to handle each row's justification, but there are more complex algorithms that can achieve better results in certain scenarios.
