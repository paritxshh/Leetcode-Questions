â€‹This code is a Java solution to a common programming problem known as "Counting Bits." The goal of this problem is to count the number of 1s in the binary 
representation of each number from '0 to n', and then return an array containing these counts.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. 'public int[] countBits(int n)' is the method definition. It takes an integer 'n' as input and returns an array of integers.
  
2. 'int[] ans = new int[n + 1]'; initializes an integer array 'ans' of size 'n + 1'. This array will store the count of set bits (1s) for each number from '0 to n'.

3. The 'for' loop iterates from '1 to n' (inclusive) using the variable 'i'.

4. Inside the loop, ans[i] = ans[i / 2] + (i % 2 == 0 ? 0 : 1); calculates the number of set bits in the binary representation of the current number i. Here's how it 
   works:
   - 'i / 2' calculates the count of set bits for the number 'i' divided by 2. This is because when you divide a binary number by 2, you essentially shift all its 
      bits one position to the right. For example, if i is 6 (110 in binary), 'i / 2' is 3 (11 in binary).
   - '(i % 2 == 0 ? 0 : 1)' checks if the least significant bit (LSB) of 'i' is 0 or 1. If it's 0, it adds 0 to the count; if it's 1, it adds 1 to the 'count'.
   - This ternary condition accounts for whether the last bit of i is set.
   - The sum of these two values gives the total count of set bits in the binary representation of i.

5. After the loop completes, the 'ans' array contains the count of set bits for each number from '0 to n'.

6. Finally, the method returns the 'ans' array.
