This code defines a Java class named 'Solution' that contains a method called 'printTree'. This method takes a 'TreeNode' representing the root of a binary tree 
and returns a list of lists of strings that represents the binary tree in a specific format. The goal is to print the binary tree in a way that it looks like it's 
viewed from the top down, with each level of the tree occupying a row in the output, and the tree is perfectly balanced.

Here's an overview of how the code works:â€‹

1. It first calculates the maximum height of the binary tree using the 'maxHeight' method. The height of a binary tree is the length of the longest path from the 
   root to a leaf node. This height is used to determine the number of rows in the output and the width of each row.

2. It calculates the width of each row in the output, which is '(2^maxHeight) - 1'. This is because at each level of the tree, there can be at most '2^level' 
   nodes, and subtracting '1' accounts for the spaces between nodes.

3. It initializes a list 'ans' to store the final output. This list will have m rows (where m is the maximum height of the tree), and each row is represented as a 
   list of strings.

4. It initializes a list 'row' to store an empty row with the width calculated in step 2.

5. It iterates through the height of the tree '(from 0 to m-1)' and adds 'row' (a copy of an empty row) to the 'ans' list. This step creates an empty grid with 'm' 
   rows and 'n' columns, where 'n' is the width calculated earlier.

6. It calls the 'dfs' (Depth-First Search) method to populate the 'ans' list with the values of the tree nodes. The 'dfs' method takes the root of the current 
   subtree, the current row, and the left and right bounds of the current row. It recursively fills in the values in the grid, ensuring that the values are 
   centered in the current row.

7. Finally, it returns the 'ans' list, which represents the binary tree printed in the desired format.


Overall, this code uses a depth-first traversal approach to populate the output grid, ensuring that the values of the tree nodes are correctly positioned according 
to their level in the tree. The resulting list of lists represents the binary tree as specified in the problem statement.
