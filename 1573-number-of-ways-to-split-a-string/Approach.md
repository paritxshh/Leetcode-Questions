This Java code defines a class 'Solution' with a method 'numWays' that calculates the number of ways to split a binary string s into three non-empty substrings with 
an equal number of '1's in each substring. The method takes the input string 's' and returns an integer representing the number of valid splits modulo 1,000,000,007.

Here's a breakdown of the approach:â€‹

1. 'kMod' is a constant representing the modulo value used to ensure the final result stays within a specific range.

2. The variable 'ones' is calculated by counting the number of '1's in the input string 's'.

3. If the count of '1's in the string is not divisible by 3, it means it's impossible to split the string into three substrings with an equal number of '1's, so the 
    method returns 0.

4. If there are no '1's in the string (ones == 0), the method calculates the number of ways to split the string by finding the number of valid positions for the 
first and second cuts (indexes) and returning the product of those counts modulo 'kMod'.

5. If there are '1's in the string, the code iterates through the string and identifies the positions where the first and second substrings should end and where the 
second and third substrings should start. These positions are determined based on the count of '1's and their distribution in the string.

6. The final result is calculated as the product of the differences between relevant positions, specifically '(s2Start - s1End)' and '(s3Start - s2End)', modulo 
    'kMod'.


This solution leverages the fact that if the total count of '1's is divisible by 3, then the string can be split into three equal '1'-count substrings, and the 
number of valid splits is determined by finding suitable positions for the splits. The modulo operation is applied to the result to keep it within a manageable range.
