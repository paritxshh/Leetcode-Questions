Tâ€‹his Java code defines a 'Solution' class with a method called 'groupThePeople'. This method takes an integer array 'groupSizes' as input and returns a list of 
lists of integers. The goal of this method is to group people based on their group sizes.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. Initialize an empty list 'ans' to store the final result, which will be a list of lists of integers.
  
2. Create a HashMap named 'groupSizeToIndices' to map group sizes to the indices of people belonging to that group size. The 'key' is the group size, and the  
   'value' is a list of indices.

3. Iterate through the 'groupSizes' array using a 'for' loop.
   - For each element at index 'i', get the 'groupSize' from the array.
   - Use 'putIfAbsent' to create an empty list for the 'groupSize' if it doesn't exist in the 'groupSizeToIndices' map.
   - Add the current index 'i' to the list associated with the 'groupSize'.

4. Iterate through the entries of the 'groupSizeToIndices' map using a 'for-each' loop.
   - For each entry (group size and list of indices), extract the group size into 'groupSize' and the list of indices into 'indices'.
   - Create a new list called 'groupIndices' to temporarily store the indices for the current group.
   - Iterate through the 'indices' list.
       - Add each index to the 'groupIndices' list.
       - Check if the size of the 'groupIndices' list is equal to the 'groupSize'. If it is, this means that the current group is complete, so add a copy of 
         'groupIndices' to the 'ans' list.
       - Clear the 'groupIndices' list to start building the next group.

5. Finally, return the 'ans' list containing the grouped people.


In summary, this code groups people with the same group size by storing their indices in a map and then creates subgroups of the specified size, adding them to the 
final result list.
