â€‹This code defines a Java class named 'Solution' with a method 'minimumCost' that takes a string 's' as input and returns a long integer representing the minimum cost 
according to a certain algorithm. 

Let's break down the approach taken by the code:

1. 'final int n = s.length();':
   - This line calculates the length of the input string 's' and stores it in the variable 'n'.

2. 'long ans = 0;':
   - Initialize a variable 'ans' of type 'long' to store the minimum cost. This variable will be used to accumulate the cost as the algorithm processes the string.

3. The 'for' loop iterates through each character in the string, starting from the second character (index 1) because comparisons are made with the previous 
      character.

4. 'if (s.charAt(i) != s.charAt(i - 1))':
   - This condition checks whether the current character is different from the previous character. If it is, that means we have found a point of change or 
      transition 
    in the string.

5. 'ans += Math.min(i, n - i);':
   - If a transition point is found, the code calculates the cost associated with that transition and adds it to the 'ans' variable.
   - The cost is calculated as the minimum of two values: 'i' and 'n - i'.
   - This cost calculation can be understood as the distance from the current transition point to either the beginning of the string ('i') or the end of the string 
      '(n - i)'.
   - The 'Math.min' function is used to choose the smaller of these two distances.

6. The loop continues iterating through the string, identifying transition points, and accumulating the minimum cost as described above.

7. Finally, the method returns the accumulated minimum cost stored in the 'ans' variable.


In summary, the algorithm aims to calculate the minimum cost associated with transitioning from one character to another in the given string 's'. The cost is calculated based on the distance from the current transition point to either end of the string. The code accumulates these costs and returns the total minimum cost.
