The problem "Maximum Population Year" (LeetCode 1854) can be approached using the following steps:

1. Create an array 'yrs' of size 101 (from 1950 to 2050) to store population changes.

2. Loop through the logs array:
   - For each birth year, increment years[birthYear - 1950] to indicate a population increase.
   - For each death year, decrement years[deathYear - 1950] to indicate a population decrease.

3. Initialize variables 'maxpop', 'maxyr', and 'currpop'.

4. Loop through the 'yrs' array:
   - Add the current population change to 'currpop'.
   - If 'currpop' is greater than 'maxpop', update 'maxpop' and 'maxyr'.

5. Return the 'maxyr'.


This approach works because it effectively accumulates the population changes over time and identifies the year with the highest cumulative population.
