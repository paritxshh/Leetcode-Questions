â€‹The provided Java code appears to be an implementation of an algorithm to find the minimum sum of lengths of two non-overlapping subarrays in the input array "arr" 
such that their sum is equal to the target value. Here's an explanation of the approach used in the code:

1. Initialize variables:
   - 'ans' is initialized to Integer.MAX_VALUE, which will be used to keep track of the minimum sum of lengths.
   - 'sum' is initialized to 0, which represents the sum of elements within the current window.
   - 'best' is an array of the same length as 'arr', initialized with all elements set to 'Integer.MAX_VALUE'. This array will be used to store the minimum length 
     of subarrays ending at each index r that sums up to the target value.

2. Iterate through the input array using a two-pointer approach '(l and r)'. The goal is to find subarrays whose sum equals the target value.

3. For each 'r' (right) pointer, expand the window by adding the element at the 'rth' position to the 'sum'.

4. While the 'sum' is greater than the 'target' value, shrink the window from the left side by incrementing the 'l' (left) pointer and subtracting the element at 
   the 'lth' position from the 'sum'.
   - This step ensures that the sum of elements within the window is less than or equal to the 'target' value.

5. If the 'sum' becomes equal to the target value, it means a subarray with the desired sum has been found.
   - Calculate the length of this subarray as 'r - l + 1'.
   - If there was a previously found subarray ending at index 'l - 1', calculate the sum of lengths of both subarrays '(best[l - 1] + r - l + 1)'.
   - Update the 'ans' variable with the minimum of the current answer and this 'sum'.

6. Update the best array at index 'r' with the minimum length of the subarray ending at index 'r'.

7. Finally, update the best array for all 'r' (right) indices by taking the minimum of the current value and the previous value at 'r - 1'. This step ensures that 
   'best[r]' contains the minimum length of subarray ending at index 'r' throughout the iteration.

8. After the loop, check if 'ans' remains 'Integer.MAX_VALUE', indicating that no valid subarrays were found.
   - In that case, return '-1'. Otherwise, return the value stored in 'ans', which represents the minimum sum of lengths of two non-overlapping subarrays.
