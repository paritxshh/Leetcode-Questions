The provided code is a Java solution to detect whether a singly-linked list has a cycle or not. It uses the Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm, also known as the two-pointer technique. Here's how it works:

Initialize two pointers, slow and fast, both initially pointing to the head of the linked list.

Move the fast pointer twice as fast as the slow pointer. In each iteration of the loop, slow moves one step, and fast moves two steps.

If there is no cycle in the linked list, the fast pointer will eventually reach the end (i.e., become null), and at that point, you can conclude that there is no cycle, and the function returns false.

If there is a cycle in the linked list, the fast pointer will eventually catch up to the slow pointer within the cycle. When this happens, the condition slow == fast becomes true, and the function returns true to indicate the presence of a cycle.â€‹
