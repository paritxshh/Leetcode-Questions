â€‹This Java code defines a class 'Solution' with a method 'minOperations', which takes an array of integers 'nums' as input and returns the minimum number of 
operations required to make all elements of the array equal to '1'. The operations allowed are finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers and 
subtracting '1' from an element.

Here's a breakdown of the approach:

1. First, it calculates the 'count' of '1s' in the input array 'nums' using 'Java Streams'.

2. If there are already '1s' in the array (ones > 0), then the minimum number of operations needed is equal to the length of the array minus the count of '1s'.
   - This is because you don't need to perform any operations on the '1s'; they are already at the desired value of '1'.

3. If there are no '1s' in the array, it proceeds to find the minimum number of operations needed to create a subarray with a GCD of '1'.
   - It initializes 'minOps' to 'Integer.MAX_VALUE' to keep track of the minimum operations.

4. It then uses a nested loop to iterate through all possible subarrays within 'nums'.
   - The outer loop (i) represents the starting index of the subarray, and the inner loop (j) iterates over the subarray elements.

5. Inside the inner loop, it calculates the GCD of the elements within the subarray from index 'i' to 'j' using the 'gcd' function.

6. If the GCD becomes 1, it means that the subarray has a GCD of 1, and this is a candidate for the shortest subarray with a GCD of 1.
   - It updates 'minOps' to be the minimum of its current value and the length of the subarray '(j - i)'.

7. After the loops complete, 'minOps' will contain the length of the shortest subarray with a GCD of 1.

8. Finally, it returns the 'result'. If 'minOps' is still equal to 'Integer.MAX_VALUE',
   - It means no subarray with a GCD of 1 was found, so it returns '-1'.
   - Otherwise, it returns 'minOps plus n - 1', where 'n' is the length of the input array.
   - This accounts for the additional operations needed to make the remaining elements of the array equal to 1.


In summary, this code efficiently finds the minimum number of operations to make all elements of the array equal to 1 by either finding a subarray with a GCD of 1 
or directly subtracting 1 from elements with the value of 1.
