â€‹The given code is a Java solution to a problem that aims to count the number of possible orders for a certain task. 

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the approach:

1. The code defines a class 'Solution' with a single method 'countOrders' that takes an integer 'n' as input and returns an integer.

2. It defines a constant 'kMod' with the value '1,000,000,007'. This constant is used for modulo operations to prevent integer overflow and maintain the result 
   within a certain range.

3. It initializes a long variable 'ans' to '1'. This variable will store the final answer.

4. The code enters a 'for' loop that iterates from 'i = 1' to 'i <= n'.

5. Inside the loop, it updates the 'ans' variable using the following mathematical operations:
   - 'ans' is multiplied by 'i'.
   - Then, it is multiplied by '(i * 2 - 1)'. This expression calculates 'i * 2 - 1'.

6. After each multiplication, the result is taken modulo 'kMod' to keep the value within a reasonable range.

7. The loop continues until 'i' reaches 'n', and each time, 'ans' is updated based on the mathematical operations.

8. Finally, the method returns '(int) ans', converting the long 'result' back to an integer before returning it.


The code essentially calculates the product of a series of numbers '(1 * 3 * 5 * ... * (2n - 1))' and takes the result modulo 'kMod'. This is a common approach in 
combinatorics problems, where you need to count the number of possible arrangements or orders of elements. The modulo operation ensures that the result remains 
within a specified range, typically to handle large numbers and avoid integer overflow.
