â€‹This code represents a Java solution to perform postorder traversal on a binary tree and store the values of its nodes in a List. 

Let's break down the approach step by step:

1. Class Definition:
   - The code defines a class named Solution which presumably contains methods for solving a specific problem related to binary trees.

2. Method postorderTraversal:
   - This method takes a parameter root of type TreeNode, representing the root node of the binary tree for which you want to perform postorder traversal. It returns       a list of integers (List<Integer>) containing the postorder traversal sequence.
3. Method postorder:
   - This is a private helper method used recursively to perform the postorder traversal. It takes two parameters: the current root node and the ans list where the         traversal result will be stored.

4. Postorder Traversal:
   Postorder traversal means visiting the nodes in the following order: left subtree, right subtree, root node. This is done recursively in the postorder method.
   - The method first checks if the current root node is null. If it is, the method returns immediately, as there's nothing to traverse.
   - If the current root node is not null, the method recursively calls itself on the left subtree (root.left) and then on the right subtree (root.right).
   - Finally, the value of the current root node (root.val) is added to the ans list.

5. Main Method:
   - In the postorderTraversal method, a new ArrayList called ans is created to store the traversal result.
   - The postorder method is then called with the root of the binary tree and the ans list. After the traversal is complete, the ans list containing the postorder         traversal sequence is returned.
