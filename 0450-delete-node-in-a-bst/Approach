The given code is an implementation of the deleteNode function for a binary search tree (BST). This function aims to delete a node with a given key from the BST 
while maintaining the BST properties.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the approach used in the code:

1. The 'deleteNode' function takes two arguments: the root node of the BST and the key to be deleted.

2. The base case is that if the root node is 'null', then there is no node to delete, so it returns 'null'.

3. If the key to be deleted is found in the current root node (root.val == key), the code handles three cases:
  - If the root has only a left child (root.right == null), the function returns the left child, effectively removing the root.
  - If the root has only a right child (root.left == null), the function returns the right child, again effectively removing the root.
  - If the root has both left and right children, it finds the minimum node in the right subtree using the 'getMin' function. This minimum node will be used to 
    replace the root node. The right subtree of the root is modified by recursively calling the 'deleteNode' function with the minimum node's value. Then, the left 
    child of the root is assigned to the minimum node's left child, and the right child is assigned to the minimum node's right child. Finally, the root is updated 
    to be the minimum node.

4. If the key to be deleted is smaller than the value of the current root node ('root.val > key'), the function recursively searches for the key in the left subtree.

5. If the key to be deleted is greater than the value of the current root node ('root.val < key'), the function recursively searches for the key in the right subtree.

6. After performing the necessary deletion and restructuring operations, the modified (or unchanged) root node is returned.

7. The 'getMin' function is a helper function that returns the minimum node in a given subtree. It iterates through the left children of nodes until it reaches a leaf node (the leftmost node).


Easy to Understand Approach:-

1. Check the Starting Point: Imagine you're looking for a number in the tree. You start at the top, which is called the root. If the root is empty (null), it means 
  there's nothing in the tree, so you're done.

2. Finding the Number to Delete: If the root has a number, you compare it to the number you want to delete. There are three possibilities:
    a. If the root's number is the same as the number you want to delete, you have a few cases to consider:
      - If the root has no "right" part, you can just replace the root with its "left" part.
      - If the root has no "left" part, you can replace the root with its "right" part.
      - If the root has both "left" and "right" parts, you find the smallest number in the "right" part of the root. You replace the root's number with that 
        smallest number, and then you need to delete that smallest number from the "right" part.

    b. If the root's number is smaller than the number you want to delete, you know the number you're looking for is probably in the "right" part of the tree. So, 
      you repeat the process with the "right" part of the tree.

    c. If the root's number is bigger than the number you want to delete, you know the number you're looking for is probably in the "left" part of the tree. So, 
      you repeat the process with the "left" part of the tree.

3. Updating the Tree: Once you've figured out which case applies and done the necessary replacements, you're almost done. You repeat this process until you find 
  the number you want to delete. When you're finished, you return the updated version of the tree without that number.

4. Finding the Smallest Number: The "getMin" part helps you find the smallest number in a part of the tree. You keep going to the left until you can't go left 
  anymore, and then you've found the smallest number.
