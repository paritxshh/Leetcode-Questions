Let's break down the query:

1. The subquery '(SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT player_id) FROM Activity)' calculates the total number of distinct players in the 'Activity' table.

2. The main part of the query calculates the fraction of players who logged in again on the day after their first login. Here's how it works:
   - The subquery '(SELECT player_id, MIN(event_date) AS first_login FROM Activity GROUP BY player_id)' retrieves the first login date for each player.
   - '(player_id, DATE_SUB(event_date, INTERVAL 1 DAY)) IN (...)' checks whether the player's second login date (the day after the first login date) matches any of 
      the pairs from the subquery. This effectively filters the players who logged in again on the day after their first login.
   - 'COUNT(DISTINCT player_id)' calculates the count of players who met the condition.

3. Finally, 'ROUND(... / ..., 2)' calculates the fraction of players who logged in again on the day after their first login, rounds it to 2 decimal places, and 
    presents it as the "fraction" column in the result.â€‹


It uses subqueries and appropriate filtering to find the desired fraction of players who logged in again on the day after their first login.
