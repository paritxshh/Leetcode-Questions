â€‹The provided Java code defines a class called Solution with a method called intToRoman. This method takes an integer num as input and returns its Roman numeral 
representation as a string.

Here's an explanation of the approach used in this code:

1. Two arrays are defined: 'values' and 'symbols'.
   - These arrays are used to map the integer values to their corresponding Roman numeral symbols.
   - Each element in the 'values' array corresponds to a unique Roman numeral value, and the corresponding symbol is stored in the 'symbols' array at the same index.

2. A 'StringBuilder' called 'sb' is initialized. This 'StringBuilder' will be used to build the Roman numeral representation of the input integer.

3. A loop iterates through the 'values' array from largest to smallest values. Inside the loop:
   - It checks if 'num' is equal to 0. If 'num' is already converted to Roman numerals, the loop breaks.
   - It enters a nested while loop as long as 'num' is greater than or equal to the current value in the 'values' array.

3. Inside the nested loop, it subtracts the current value from 'num' and appends the corresponding symbol to the 'StringBuilder sb'. This process continues until 
   'num' is less than the current value.

4. Finally, the method returns the string representation of the Roman numeral stored in the StringBuilder 'sb'.
