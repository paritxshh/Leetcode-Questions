â€‹This Java code defines a class Solution with a method 'isReachable' that takes two integers 'targetX' and 'targetY' as parameters and returns a boolean value. 

This method determines whether a point ('targetX', 'targetY') is reachable from the origin '(0, 0)' using a specific criterion.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The 'isReachable' method:
   - It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 'targetX' and 'targetY' using the 'gcd' method.
   - The 'gcd' method is a recursive implementation of the Euclidean algorithm, which computes the GCD of two integers.

2. After calculating the GCD, it uses 'Integer.bitCount' to count the number of set bits (1s) in the binary representation of the GCD.

3. It then checks if the count of set bits in the GCD is equal to 1.
   - If the count is 1, it returns true, indicating that the point '(targetX, targetY)' is reachable from the origin.
   - If the count is not 1, it returns false, indicating that the point is not reachable from the origin.


The core idea behind this code is that it checks whether the GCD of 'targetX' and 'targetY' is a power of 2, i.e., whether it has only one set bit in its binary 
representation. If the GCD has only one set bit, it means that the point '(targetX, targetY)' lies on a line that passes through the origin, making it reachable.

Here's an example of how this code works:

1. If you call 'isReachable(4, 8)', it calculates the GCD as '4', which has two set bits in its binary representation '(100)'. Therefore, it returns false because 
   the GCD doesn't have only one set bit.

2. If you call 'isReachable(3, 5)', it calculates the GCD as '1', which has one set bit in its binary representation '(1)'. Therefore, it returns true because the 
   GCD has only one set bit, indicating that the point is reachable from the origin.


This code provides a unique criterion for determining whether a point is reachable from the origin based on the binary representation of the GCD.
