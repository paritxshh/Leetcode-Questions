â€‹This code is an implementation of an algorithm to find the minimum cost to connect all points in a set of 2D points using the Manhattan distance metric. 

The algorithm used here is a variation of Kruskal's algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree of a graph. 

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the approach:

1. Initialize an array 'dist' of size equal to the number of points. This array will store the minimum distance to connect each point.

2. Initialize all elements of 'dist' to 'Integer.MAX_VALUE', indicating that initially, there is no known minimum distance to any point.

3. Initialize a variable 'ans' to '0'. This variable will accumulate the total minimum cost as we connect the points.

4. The main part of the algorithm is a nested loop. The outer loop iterates through the points from the first point to the second-to-last point.

5. The inner loop iterates through the remaining points (from 'i+1' to the last point), effectively considering all possible edges between the current point 
   ('points[i]') and the remaining points.

6. Inside the inner loop, the code calculates the Manhattan distance between 'points[i]' and 'points[j]' using the absolute differences of their 'x' and 'y' 
   coordinates.
   - This distance is stored in the 'dist' array as the minimum distance to connect 'points[i]' and 'points[j]'.

7. After calculating the distance, the code checks if the distance to 'points[j]' is less than the distance to the next point '(dist[i + 1])'.
   - If so, it swaps 'points[j]' with the next point to consider '(points[i + 1])' and updates their distances accordingly.
   - This step ensures that the point with the minimum distance becomes the next point to consider in the outer loop.

8. Finally, the code adds the distance to the next point '(dist[i + 1])' to the 'ans' variable.
   - This distance represents the cost of connecting the current point to the nearest unconnected point.

9. After completing the outer loop, the 'ans' variable contains the minimum cost to connect all points in the input.


In essence, the code is iteratively building the minimum spanning tree by selecting the edge with the smallest Manhattan distance at each step, and it accumulates 
the total cost of building this tree. The algorithm ensures that each point is connected to the nearest unconnected point until all points are connected, resulting 
in the minimum cost to connect all points.
