â€‹The given code implements a solution to generate Gray Code sequences of length 'n'. Gray Code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only 
one bit. In this code, each element in the sequence is an integer representing a binary number.

Let's break down the approach used in this code:

1. Initialize 'ans' as an empty ArrayList to store the generated Gray Code sequence.

2. Add the initial value '0' to the 'ans' list. The Gray Code sequence always starts with 0.

3. The outer loop iterates 'n' times, where 'n' is the desired length of the Gray Code sequence.

4. Inside the outer loop, there's an inner loop that iterates through the elements currently present in the 'ans' list in reverse order.

5. For each element 'num' in the current 'ans' list, the code computes a new value by performing a bitwise OR operation (|) between 'num' and '1 << i'. Here, 'i' is 
    the current iteration of the outer loop.

6. The expression '1 << i' calculates a value with the i-th bit set to 1 and all other bits set to 0. This effectively flips the i-th bit of num.

7. The newly calculated value is then added to the 'ans' list.

8. After both loops complete, the 'ans' list contains the Gray Code sequence of length n.

9. Finally, the 'ans' list is returned as the result.


The overall idea is to generate the Gray Code sequence iteratively by adding new values based on the previous values. The bitwise manipulation ensures that only one bit changes between consecutive numbers, which satisfies the Gray Code property.
