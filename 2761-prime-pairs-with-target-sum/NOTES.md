The given Java code defines a Solution class with a method named findPrimePairs that takes an integer n as input and returns a list of pairs of prime numbers that 
add up to n. 
The method uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to efficiently find prime numbers and then checks for pairs of primes that add up to the given n.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the approach:â€‹

1. The sieveEratosthenes method implements the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate a boolean array isPrime, where isPrime[i] will be true if i is a prime 
    number and false otherwise. The method starts by assuming that all numbers from 0 to n - 1 are prime.

2. It then marks 0 and 1 as not prime, since they are not considered prime numbers.

3. The outer loop iterates over the numbers from 2 to the square root of n. For each number i, if it's marked as prime (isPrime[i] is true), it enters an inner 
    loop.

4. The inner loop starts from i * i (since all smaller multiples of i would have already been marked as not prime by the time i is processed). It iterates through 
    the multiples of i up to n - 1 and marks them as not prime by setting isPrime[j] to false.

5. After the sieveEratosthenes method completes, the boolean array isPrime contains information about prime and non-prime numbers up to n - 1.

6. In the findPrimePairs method, an empty list of lists named ans is initialized to store pairs of prime numbers.

7. The loop iterates from 2 to n / 2 (inclusive), checking each value of i. For each i, it checks whether both i and n - i are prime numbers (as determined by the 
    isPrime array). If both are prime, it means that the pair (i, n - i) adds up to n, and this pair is added to the ans list.

8. Finally, the method returns the ans list, containing pairs of prime numbers that add up to the given input n.


The overall approach is to use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to efficiently find prime numbers up to n, and then check for prime pairs that satisfy the 
condition i + (n - i) = n. The pairs that meet this condition are added to the result list.
