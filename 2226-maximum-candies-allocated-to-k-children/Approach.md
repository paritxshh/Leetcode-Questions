- This code uses binary search to find the maximum number of candies each child can receive while ensuring that at least 'k' candies are given to each child. It 
  calculates the minimum and maximum possible number of candies per child '(l and r)' based on the sum of candies divided by 'k'.

- Then, in a binary search loop, it calculates the middle value 'm' between 'l' and 'r' and checks how many children can receive at least 'k' candies with that value.
  
- If this count is too high, it narrows the range from the right '(r = m)'. If the count is too low, it narrows the range from the left '(l = m + 1)'.

- The loop continues until 'l' and 'r' converge. The final value of 'l' represents the maximum number of candies each child can receive while ensuring k candies per 
  child.

- The 'numChildren' function calculates the total number of children who can receive at least m candies by evenly distributing the candies and counting how many 
  children meet or exceed that amount.

- The method returns the maximum number of candies per child that still satisfies the condition of giving each child at least k candies. This way, it optimizes the 
  distribution to maximize the total candy count while ensuring fairness.
