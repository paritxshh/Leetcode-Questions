The code provided is a compact and efficient solution to the Binary Gap problem. Let's break down the code:

1. int ans = 0:
   - Initialize a variable ans to keep track of the maximum gap length.
  
2. The for loop iterates while n is greater than 0. In each iteration, the loop:
   - Divides n by 2 (n /= 2) to perform a right shift, effectively checking each bit from right to left.
   - Increments the variable d to keep track of the distance between two consecutive 1s.
  
3. Inside the loop, (n & 1) == 1 checks whether the rightmost bit of n is 1. If it is, it means a 1 is encountered in the binary representation.

4. If a 1 is encountered, it means a gap is ending, so the code updates the ans variable by taking the maximum of ans and d (the current gap distance).

5. After updating the ans, the code resets d to 0, as it starts counting the distance for the next gap.

6. Finally, the loop continues with the next iteration.

7. The function returns ans, which holds the length of the longest gap between two 1s in the binary representation.


This solution leverages the fact that the rightmost 1 in the binary representation of a number indicates the end of a gap, and the distance between consecutive 1s is tracked to find the maximum gap length. This approach is both elegant and efficient.
