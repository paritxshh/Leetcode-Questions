â€‹The given Java code defines a class 'Solution' with a 'generate' method that generates Pascal's Triangle up to a specified number of rows '(numRows)'. 
Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of binomial coefficients, where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. 'List<List<Integer>> ans = new ArrayList<>()': This line initializes a list of lists '(ans)' to store the rows of Pascal's Triangle.

2. The first 'for' loop runs from 'i = 0' to 'i < numRows', where 'i' represents the current row number. Inside this loop, it does the following:
   - 'Integer[] temp = new Integer[i + 1]': It creates an array 'temp' of integers with a length of 'i + 1'. This is because each row in Pascal's Triangle has one 
      more element than its row number.
   - 'Arrays.fill(temp, 1)': It fills the 'temp' array with 1s. The first and last elements of each row in Pascal's Triangle are always '1'.
   - 'ans.add(Arrays.asList(temp))': It converts the 'temp' array to a list and adds it to the 'ans' list. This represents a row in Pascal's Triangle.

3. After the first 'for' loop, the 'ans' list now contains the first 'numRows' rows of Pascal's Triangle, each represented as a list of integers.

4. The second 'for' loop runs from 'i = 2' to 'i < numRows'. This loop iterates over each row starting from the third row because the first two rows are filled with 
   1s and don't need further computation.
   - Inside this loop, there's another 'for' loop that runs from 'j = 1' to 'j < ans.get(i).size() - 1'. It iterates over the elements in the current row, excluding  
     the first and last elements (which are 1s).
   - 'ans.get(i).set(j, ans.get(i - 1).get(j - 1) + ans.get(i - 1).get(j))': For each element at row 'i' and column 'j', it computes the value by summing the 
     corresponding elements from the previous row '(row i - 1)' at columns 'j - 1' and 'j'. This is how Pascal's Triangle is constructed.

5. Finally, the method returns the 'ans' list, which contains the complete Pascal's Triangle up to 'numRows'.


So, if you call the 'generate' method with 'numRows' as the input, it will return a list of lists representing Pascal's Triangle with that many rows.
