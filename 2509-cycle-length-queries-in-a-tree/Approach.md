â€‹This code is a Java solution to a problem involving finding the cycle length for a given range of values. 

Let me break down the approach used in this code:

1. Initialize an array 'ans' to store the answers for each query. The length of this array is equal to the number of queries provided.

2. Loop through each query using a 'for' loop with the loop variable 'i'.

3. Increment 'ans[i]' by '1' initially. This is because you start counting from '1', not '0'.

4. Extract the values 'a' and 'b' from the current query using 'queries[i][0]' and 'queries[i][1]', respectively.
   - These values likely represent the starting and ending points of the range for which you want to find the cycle length.

5. Enter a while loop that continues until 'a' becomes equal to 'b'. Inside this loop:
   - Check if 'a' is greater than 'b'. If it is, divide 'a' by '2' '(a /= 2)'.
   - If 'b' is greater than 'a', divide 'b' by '2' '(b /= 2)'.
   - Increment 'ans[i]' by '1' with each iteration. This increment keeps track of the number of steps it takes to reach the common point where 'a' equals 'b'.

6. Once the while loop exits, it means 'a' and 'b' are equal, and you have found the common point.
   - The 'ans[i]' variable now contains the cycle length for this particular query.

7. Repeat this process for all queries, and store the cycle lengths in the 'ans' array.

8. Finally, return the 'ans' array containing the cycle lengths for all the queries.


In summary, this code calculates the cycle length for a given range of values defined by the queries. It does so by continuously dividing the values a and b by 2 
until they become equal while keeping track of the number of steps it takes to reach that common point.
