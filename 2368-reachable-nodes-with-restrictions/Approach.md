This Java code defines a class 'Solution' with a method 'reachableNodes' that calculates the number of reachable nodes in a graph. The graph is represented as a 
tree, and certain nodes are marked as restricted, meaning they cannot be visited. The code uses depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the tree and count the 
reachable nodes.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. Create an array of Lists called 'tree', where each index represents a node, and the list at each index stores the neighboring nodes. Initialize a boolean array 
   called 'seen' to keep track of visited nodes.

2. Populate the tree array based on the edges input. For each edge in edges, add the adjacent nodes to each other's lists in the tree array to represent an 
   undirected graph.

3. Mark nodes in the 'seen' array as true if they are restricted (given in the restricted array).

4. Call the 'dfs' method starting from node 0, passing the 'tree' array and 'seen' array as arguments. This method will return the count of reachable nodes from 
   node 0, taking restricted nodes into account.

5. The 'dfs' method is a recursive function that performs a depth-first search. It takes the 'tree' array, the current node 'u', and the 'seen' array as parameters.

6. If the current node 'u' is marked as 'seen' (i.e., restricted), return 0, as it cannot be visited.

7. Mark the current node 'u' as seen by setting 'seen[u]' to true.

8. Initialize a variable 'ans' to 1 to count the current node.

9. Iterate through the neighbors of the current node 'u' (nodes in the 'tree[u]' list) and recursively call the 'dfs' method on each neighbor. Add the result of 
   each recursive call to the ans variable to count the reachable nodes.

10. Return the 'ans' variable, which represents the count of reachable nodes from the starting node (node 0).


In summary, this code calculates the number of reachable nodes in a tree-like graph while considering restricted nodes. It does so by performing a depth-first 
search from a starting node (node 0) and counting the reachable nodes while marking restricted nodes as seen.
