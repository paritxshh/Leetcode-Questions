I'll break down what I have done step by step:

1. The input 'num' is first converted to a character array cr using 'String.valueOf(num).toCharArray()'. This allows you to manipulate each digit of the number.

2. The 'Arrays.sort(cr)' method is used to sort the character array in ascending order. This step is crucial as it arranges the digits in a way that will result in 	the minimum possible sum.

3. The return statement calculates the minimum sum by rearranging the digits as follows:
   - (cr[0] - '0') * 10: This takes the smallest digit after sorting and multiplies it by 10 to shift it to the tens place.
   - (cr[2] - '0'): This takes the second smallest digit, which is now in the hundreds place.
   - (cr[1] - '0') * 10: This takes the third smallest digit and multiplies it by 10 to shift it to the tens place.
   - (cr[3] - '0'): This takes the largest digit, which is now in the thousands place.

By arranging the digits in this way, you're effectively creating the smallest number possible from the given digits, leading to the minimum possible sum.
