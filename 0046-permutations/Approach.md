â€‹This Java code implements a solution to generate all permutations of an input array of integers 'nums'. It uses a depth-first search '(DFS)' approach to explore 
all possible permutations. 

Here's how the code works:

1. It starts by initializing an empty list 'ans' to store the permutations.

2. The 'permute' method is the entry point for generating permutations.
   - It takes the input array 'nums' and initializes a boolean array used to keep track of whether a number has been used in the current permutation.
   - It also initializes an empty list 'path' to represent the current permutation being built.

3. The 'dfs' method is a recursive helper function that generates permutations. It takes four parameters:
   - 'nums': The input array of integers.
   - 'used': A boolean array to track which elements of 'nums' have been used in the current permutation.
   - 'path': A list representing the current permutation.
   - 'ans': The list of lists where the generated permutations are stored.

4. Inside the 'dfs' method, it checks whether the 'path' list has reached the desired length, which is equal to the length of the 'nums' array.
   - If so, it means that a valid permutation has been found, and it adds a copy of the 'path' list to the 'ans' list.

5. If the length of 'path' is not equal to the length of 'nums', it enters a loop that iterates through the elements of 'nums'.
   - For each element, it checks if it has been used in the current permutation '(used[i] == true)'. If it has been used, it continues to the next element.

6. If the element has not been used '(used[i] == false)', it marks it as used '(used[i] = true)', adds it to the 'path' list, and recursively calls the 'dfs' 
   method to continue building the permutation.

7. After the recursive call returns, it removes the last element from the path list '(backtracks)' and marks the element as unused '(used[i] = false)'.
   - This backtracking step is essential for exploring all possible permutations.

8. The process continues until all valid permutations have been generated.

9. Finally, the 'permute' method returns the 'ans' list, which contains all the permutations.
